            "In the new internet, it will be harder for big companies to access peoples personal information."
            "Countries cannot ban some programs and destroy their business in this system. A world of freedom where everyone can act freely. Of course, this goal of the NEAR network is not a new concept; In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto also pursued the same goal by introducing Bitcoin in 2008. But Bitcoin has created this freedom only in the financial sphere."
            "Ethereum and many other projects, including Near, also seek to extend this freedom to other aspects of human life. So far, we have found that the Near network is a platform for creating decentralized applications; Exactly what Ethereum does.")

    st.caption("To track developer activity on NEAR one can take a closer look at repositories on Github and announcements on Twitter. These sources are easily available to the public, while development in private is not easy to track and measure. Nevertheless, research reports from groups like Electric Capital and Outlier Ventures also rely on Github repository activity to measure activity of development communities of blockchain platforms."
                "For activity on NEAR we analyzed the main NEAR Github repository and its eight most frequently utilized and related repositories (near-explorer, nearcore, create-near-app, docs, near-wallet, near-api-js, sdk-docs, near-sdk-as, near-cli) for commits and forks in the past 12 months. Additionally, three main NEAR-affiliated twitter accounts (@nearprotocol, @pagodaplatform, @nearweek) were scraped for project announcements during the past 12 months. The rationale for scaling each metric to its respective weight is explained below."
                "A scaled ‚Äúdevelopment activity‚Äù score was produced by totaling the following activities each week over the past year and weighing them based on how much each activity is indicative of substantive development activity on Substrate:"
